            <p>I am a fresh graduate of Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Popularly known as ICHIE.
                I am naturally very ambitious especially if the ambition has "cheddah" written allover.
                I can be shy at times and at other times you'll be wowed but this strongly depends on the
                people i am with and the environment.
                I am also like parties but i don't attends parties neither do i go out (lol). I am enroute
                to being a full stack daveloper.
                I am currently learning how to be a frontend developer with the JUST PROJECTS COHORT 4.
                Asides from tech i also have a thing for farming both livestock and crops.
                I enjoy doing a couple of things like;
                <ul>
                    <li>playing and watching football</li>
                    <li>listening to music</li>                
                    <li>learning new things</li>
                    <li>hanging out with friends</li>
                    <li>eating good food</li>           
                </ul>
            </p>
