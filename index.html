          I am a fresh graduate of Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Popularly
          known as ICHIE. I am naturally very ambitious especially if the
          ambition has "cheddah" written allover. I can be shy at times and at
          other times you'll be wowed but this strongly depends on the people i
          am with and the environment. I also like parties but i don't
          attends parties neither do i go out (lol). I am enroute to being a
          full stack developer. I am currently learning the basics on how to be
          a frontend developer with the JUST PROJECTS COHORT 4.

          Asides from tech i also have a thing for farming both livestock and
          crops. I enjoy playing and watching football, listening to music,
          learning new things, hanging out with friends, eating good food
          amongst other things.
